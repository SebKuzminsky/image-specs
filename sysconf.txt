# This file will be automatically evaluated and installed _only_ at
# the first boot of this image.
#
# To force it to be evaluated later, you can run (as root):
#
# /usr/sbin/set-sysconf
#
# Comments (all portions of a line following a '#' character) are
# ignored. This file is read line by line (ordering is ignored). Valid
# configuration lines are of the form 'key=value'. Whitespace around
# 'key' and 'value' is ignored.
#
# We follow the convention to indent with one space comments, and
# leave no space to indicate the line is an example that could be
# uncommented.

# root_pw - Set a password for the root user (by default, it allows
# for a passwordless login)
#root_pw=FooBar
